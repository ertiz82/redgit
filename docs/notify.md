## Environment Variables

Sensitive data should use environment variables:

|----------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Telegram chat ID |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack webhook URL |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook URL |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | MS Teams webhook URL |

```bash
# Set in shell
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="123456:ABC-DEF"
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="-1001234567890"

# Or in .env file (not committed)
```

## Interactive Features

Some platforms support interactive messages:

### Buttons (Slack, Telegram)

```python
# Used internally for Planning Poker
# Claim task buttons
# Approve/Reject buttons
```

### Polls (Telegram)

```python
# Used for quick team votes
# Sprint planning decisions
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Notification not sent"

```bash
# Check integration status
rg integration list

# Test with manual message
rg notify "Test message"

# Check logs
rg notify "Test" --verbose
```

### "Bot not responding" (Telegram)

1. Verify bot token is correct
2. Ensure bot is added to the group
3. Check chat ID (negative for groups)
4. Bot must be admin for some features

### "Webhook error" (Slack/Discord)

1. Verify webhook URL is valid
2. Check webhook hasn't been revoked
3. Ensure proper permissions

### "Event not triggering"

```bash
# Check event is enabled
rg config show

# Verify in config:
# notifications.events.push: true
```

---

## Best Practices

### Channel Organization

```yaml
# Use specific channels for different events
notifications:
  channels:
    ci: "#ci-builds"
    releases: "#releases"
    issues: "#issues"
```

### Rate Limiting

Avoid notification spam:
```yaml
notifications:
  # Disable noisy events
  events:
    commit: false    # Too frequent

  # Or use batching
  batch:
    enabled: true
    interval: 300    # 5 minutes
```

### Security

```yaml
# Use environment variables for tokens
integrations:
  telegram:
    bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}  # Never hardcode!
```
